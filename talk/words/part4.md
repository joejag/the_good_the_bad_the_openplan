# We can do better

* Hot desking, biophilic environments and break out areas are all good inventions.
* Unless you have a specialised culture, I'd avoid putting separate teams in the same room to avoid the drawbacks of open plan
* software development is a form of collaborative knowledge work. At best, we are constantly learning and sharing that knowledge. It's tempting to say the design studio approach is best, but that still is suspectible to the idea of one form wins all.

> Software dev ebbs and flows between different modes throughout the day

## Three modes of working: Cave

* 1 or 2 folk find a quiet, enclosed space
* Work is about concentration, flow and no distractions. Also 1:1s, private calls.
* Small, soundproof room with a desk and two chairs

## Three modes of working: Theatre

* A subset of the team might want to work together, like mobbing, swarming or related stories
* Work is about explicit and incidental knowledge sharing
* Enclosed, large desk, seats 8 for laptops

## Three modes of working: Lounge

* Members may want to relax, talk and socailize
* Work informally
* Sofa, bookcase, place to get drinks and healthy snacks

## Three modes - scaling

* 2 Caves, 1 Theatre and 1 Lounge.
* For more teams in the same area, add more caves and theatres and share the lounge.
* Examples at Spotify and STX Next.

## Fixing an open plan

* If you can't put up walls. The next best thing is to fix your open plan
* Make barries like Burolandschaft out of plants and movable partitions. You need to reduce the noise, which may involve removing a bank of desks to make space. This becomes your theatre.
* If you can, introduce some white noise by a water feature or something similar to mask over people talking.

* Have small booths nearby for private chats.
* Above all, keep it adaptable. Use tables on casters, keep plug sockets in the air rather than under desks.


> If your office is very high rent, like London or Hong Kong you can still do some things.

## TW London office video

Video.

 * No to ping pong table
 * Still closed in. But lot's of space to escape.

## Influcencing your org

* Org Leaders
  * Get cultural anthropologists in (you use UX for customers already)
  * Stop reducing space per employee. Give up on the magazine spread office and start asking for rooms to be added for teams.

* Team leaders
  * Ask to redesign your office area. Add noise barriers and make a theatre
  * Try to co-opt a meeting room in an unfavourable part of the building

* Individual
  * Influence your team and org leaders to add sound barriers.
  * Don't just whinge about things, offer solutions. Point to other companies like STX that have moved to dedicated rooms.
