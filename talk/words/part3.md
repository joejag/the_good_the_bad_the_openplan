# Part Three: Culture is just as important

## Rich Sheridan

* I shared my mythbusters session on open plan on Twitter as I was quite pleased to finally have studies to back up my findings. I'd even saught out counter-arguments to see if there was any proof.
* All was going well until Rich Sheridan blew a whole in my theory

## So what do Menlo do?

* Use open plan. Pair on all tasks.
* Whole org standup everyday
* Allow you to take babies in for the first year, plus they have an office dog

## Menlo Lisamarie quote

* Keys is adapability. Anyone can reposition anything, even the CEO comes in to find his desk has been moved around. It's a huge space they have, so they've chosen to be close together
* They admit this way of working is not for everyone. They have a chat after 3 weeks where they decide if they both want to continue. But their culture has totally overcome the problems with open plan spaces.
* Only 43 employees

## Menlo Rich quote

* Rich suggests that office culture and the the physcial space influence each other. Menlo's open culture can only be had by having an open plan office.
* Researching this idea of culture and physical environment led me to discover Jacob Morgan

## Jacob Morgan Book

* Jacob is interested in the evolution of the office experience and what makes a great place to work.
* He analysed the 252 companies in the US and looked to see what was key. On his way he found an evolutionary model and three critical components

## Jacob evolution

* 100 years ago orgs were based purely around utility. Bare bones tools. No leadership or motivation, here is the stuff off you go
* Productivity -> harder, better, stronger more effective. Taylorism. Stopwatches.
* Engagement: Employee happiness. What stuff can we give them, surveys. Obsessed. We've been here for a while, the scores aren't moving anymore. Managers scratch their head asking where is the RoI on this? Short term fixes, free food etc
* New era. Not just happy. Changing core workplace practices around our people (not about perks). How we lead. One level further as it involves making the deeper changes.

## Jacob Employee experience equation

* Tech: What tools, hardware do we use to do our job. How good is the video conferencing etc. If you don't have this you get disengaged and upset.
* Space: Offices, home
* Culture: 40% of experience. Meaning, purpose.

* Three levers to play with to improve experience. Amazing orgs have mastered all three.
