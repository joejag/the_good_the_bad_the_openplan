# Part Two: Open Plan Mythbusters

## Why?

* In 2019 why are we still persisting on building things open plan?

## Benefits

* Communication
* Collaboration
* Equality
* Health
* Cost

## Communication

 * People sitting all together will have more chances to communicate
 * Seems reasonable. You have more chances to interact!
 * Some evidence from three studies 10 years ago that measured email and IM usage before and after moving office styles. All showed a massive increase and assumed f2f went down

 > It would be great to have a way to measure f2f as well right?

## Socialmetric Badges

 * Sociometric badge tracking f2f conversations and also email and IM

## Socialmetric Badges: Stats
 
 * Fortune 500m. Three weeks before change and after. 73% less time in face-to-face interactions. Digital went up 67%
 * significantly reduce the amount of face-to-face interaction across the workforce
 * Example: AC two folk disagreeing sitting next to each other

## Debunked: Communication

* Some proof that is helps inter-team communication, but it's at a huge expense to team communication.

## Collaboration

* People working together to complete a goal
* Collaboration depends upon Communication as a prerequisite to work

## Matthew Davis (2011)

* 2011 Matthew Davis reviewed over 100 workplace studies.

## Collaboration (other bits)

* Most folk wear heaphones due to the unhelpful noise
* Scared and try to look busy due to lack of privacy
* Hot desking means teams other can't sit together

## A test of your working environment

* If three people wanted to work together for an afternoon, can they do it where they are?
* Do you have workboards right next to where you work?

## Debunked: Collaboration

* Psych safety is key to high performing team. It involves being able to challenge without fear. An element of privacy is required. Being exposed makes this less likely.

## Equality

* Definition that was put forwad in relation to an open office.
* Study found: Felt exposed in certain situations, for example if they had some bad news and felt emotional.
* This led to a slew of letters to a news outlet that reported on it. Here are just some.
* This has been called "Ambient Sexism". Netflix sent a memo around recently telling people not to stare at other people for more than five seconds if they aren't talking.

## Debunked: Equality

* This is mixed. It has removed "us vs them" in hierarchical terms somewhat, but it's terrible for people who feel emotional and especially annoyting for women who feel observered
* Story about pervy security dude hotdesking - moved the hotdesks to avoid perving

## Health

* It's true
* Blood flow (20->32% more active then folk in private offices or cubicles. Activity is linked to Stress)

## However, Danish study

* 2,403 workers self reported how many folk in their office and the number of sick days they took
* Sharing an office made folk take 62% more sick days (8 rather than 5)
* Speculated on the findings based on feedback

## Open Office Benefits

* You'll move around move - but you are going to get sick

## Cost

* Reduce space used by employee has been happening since the 70s. It hyper accelerated in the 2000s after the crash.
* You got me there. It takes up less space and is easier to move people around without walls.
* To make an office I'm about to suggest for collaborative knowledge work would need up to use nearly double the space.

## Open Office Benefits

* So office space cost I'll give. But I'd ask. At what cost?
* Every team I see in an open plan, with other teams mixed in, is hamstrung in some way
* They don't engage in as much productive conflict and don't spend as much time sharing knowledge with each other

> So open and shut case?
