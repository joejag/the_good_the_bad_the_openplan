> *It sounds ridiculous but because everyone was always staring at me as they walked by, I felt obligated to maintain a more formal posture all the time*

# Health

### It's healthier than sitting isolated all-day

# It's true!

## __20->32% more active__

### Occupational & Environmental Medicine (2018)

---

## Danish Ministry of Employment (2013)

### Occupants in open-plan offices (more than six people) had 62% more days of sickness absence*

![fit](images/1_denmark.png)

# Potential reasons

__(speculation)__

* higher noise exposure in the open-plan office
* more likely to be exposed to viruses
* Lack of privacy causes problems and sickness
* Reduced autonomy, leading to higher stress levels
