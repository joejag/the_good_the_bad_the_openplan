--Sir Charles Trevelyan - UK government report (1854)

> but for the more mechanical work, the working in concert of a number of clerks in the same room under proper superintendence, is the proper mode of meeting it

* Height adjustable, sit-to-stand desks (health through better blood flow).

> *felt exposed in certain situations, for example if they had some bad news and felt emotional.*
--Anglia Ruskin University (2018)

---

>  *I have been struggling with one particular male employee who stares at me seemingly without any concern for discretion*
> *I strategize alternate routes to the restroom so I don’t have to pass his desk*
--Lauren T

---

> *It sounds ridiculous but because everyone was always staring at me as they walked by, I felt obligated to maintain a more formal posture all the time*
-- Veronica G

---

> *makes me self-conscious about my choice of clothing, and distracts me from what I __should__ be concentrating on at work.*

# It's true!

## __20->32% more active__

### Occupational & Environmental Medicine (2018)

## Danish Ministry of Employment (2013)

### *Occupants in open plan offices (more than six people) had 62% more days of sickness absence*

# Potential reasons

__(speculation)__

* higher noise exposure in the open plan office
* more likely to be exposed to viruses
* Lack of privacy causes problems and sickness
* Reduced autonomy, leading to higher stress levels
