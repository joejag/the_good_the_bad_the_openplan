# Intro

* Joe Wright, Software Development Coach and consultant, operating here in Scotland
* One time I got asked to design a floor plan for dev teams and once I had my eyes opened to the impact, I've been annoyed ever since. And I'm here to give you that gift.

* Past/Presnt/Future. You will learn the history of how we got here, the problems our teams currently face and what we can do to make things better

## Quote Slide
