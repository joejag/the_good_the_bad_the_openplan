## Gov quote: thinking person

* 100 years later the government published a report saying:

```
 “for the intellectual work, separate rooms are necessary so that a person who works with his head may not be interrupted 
```

## Gov quote: mechanical work

```
but for the more mechanical work, the working in concert of a number of clerks in the same room under proper superintendence, is the proper mode of meeting it”
```
