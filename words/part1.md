# A Quick history of the office

## 1726: The Old Admiralty Office

* Some evidence of Romans having offices, but first dedicated office was in the 18th century
* Empire booming. Built in 1726 in London. The Old Admiralty Office. 
* Made to handle navy paperwork, meeting rooms and a boardroom (still used today)
* Three years later loads more dedicated offices appeared.

## Gov quote: thinking person

* 100 years later the government published a report saying:

```
 “for the intellectual work, separate rooms are necessary so that a person who works with his head may not be interrupted 
```

## Gov quote: mechanical work

```
but for the more mechanical work, the working in concert of a number of clerks in the same room under proper superintendence, is the proper mode of meeting it”
```

## Taylor image

* This idea was captured and perfected by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Agiles fav bad guy.
* Called this the scietific approach. For great efficiency.
* Failed to consider human and social elements. Maximum productivity

## Technology improved

* Electric lighting, aircon, and the telegraph system allowed offices to not be situated next to factories for the first time.
* The big changes were lifts and birth of steel frames. Which allowed sky scrapers to be created
* These changes made office design into a discipline and office design entered a new period. This new period was defined by having large rooms, with small ones off it. But mainly by having space.

## Frank Video

* Here is a video of Frank, on the first ever promotion for open plan, saying why he thinks open plan is great
* Yup, boxes are facist. I suppose in the early 20th century no one got to go around citing Godwin's law.
* Wright didn’t trust anyone’s taste over his own, so refused any furniture changes or wallpaper changes. "You'll get used to it".
* during my research I heard Open plan promoted as for comms/collab/inno but it's also anitfa

## The Johnson Wax company by Frank Lloyd Wright

* Frank Llyod Wright started experimenting with open plan offices in 1909.
* Wisconsin, 1939 he created his masterpiece. Designed a space for 200 sales workers to work together
* Notice the bright light, cork celing to trap noise and Dentriform columns (tree like)

## The Apartment Office Scene

* But most other did not take this much care with design work. 
* The desire to keep things with Taylor's scientific management style meant creamming folk in again. Recreating factories with people using pens. Desks facing the same way like a school room without a teacher.
* Rather than working in the FLW building, we worked in a shitty copy

> Thankfully the German's were around to help us out

## Burolandschaft (beauru land shaft)

* "fundamentally a reaction against Nazism"
* The 50s ad 60s brough a socially democractic vibe which looked to create a greater degree of human interaction and engagement
* Two brothers who were furniture designers wanted to rebel against the scietific method of strict grids and desks with something organic and natural with the individual as focus.
* The style became known as Burolandschaft, which means 'office landscape' after it's propogators in Hamburg, Germany.

* A key part of it was non-hierarchical, managers had previously been in separate offices, now they were sitting with their teams
* They used lower than standard occupancy levels too, to deal with the noise problem
* Desks were arranged according to roles and functions, so it wasn't “one size fits all”

* Rather than walls, plastic plants and dividers were used. It was open plan, but not as we knew it. Another novel introduction was carpet.

* For the first time a break room was introduced. This replaced a coffee cart called "The Crystal Palace" which circulated at specific hours
* Hugely succesful in Northern Europe as they didn't involve walls and it was easy to scale staff numbers up or down

* Not random. "The layout was based upon an intensive study of patterns of communication - between different parts of the organisation, different individuals," Duffy.
* It encouraged disclosure, discussion and debate

> All that was left, was to convince the americans on the idea.

## The Action Office

* Robert Propst, head of research at Herman Miller based in the USA, was an early advocate of Burolandschaft and further developed it into the "Action Office"
* This method required more space for modular furniture designed for the task at hand. The individuals workspace became bigger and enclosed, with plenty of meeting spaces around where they worked.

> One of the areas this was to help, was to do with the influx of women into the workplace

## Would you let your daughter

* Observer 1968. Boot's in Nottingham opened a huge new HQ.
* Choice comments: 
  * Now the girls are on show, they are more concientious of their appearance.
  * I have trouble concentrating now with all the visual distractions
  * I don't like the temperature, it's too cold now 

## Action growing

* Over time, every worker ended up with their own workstation and walls grew to combat noise
* But again, these were offices designed by architects who cared about the work and the workers inside them.

> You can guess what happened next

## The Cubicle Farm

* An emphasis on profitability over working conditions dominated through the 80s. Creating the much miligned Cubicle Farms. Taken to dystopian limits
* This "stack up high, sell em cheap" world view took over completely. There was some attempt at humanizing by asking folk what colour they wanted their 6ft wall to be, but that was it.
* When cubicle farms came to Germany there was uproar. As part of the "co-determination" movement, the government past a bill enshining the right to at least 28 sq mt space and natural sunlight, which persists to this day. It killed cubicle farms, but also Burolandschaft. Coupled with cheap real estate, German's enjoy the most space in Europe. Bulgaria has the least space in Europe.

## Pabst responds

> The cubiclizing of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity

> not all organisations are intelligent. Lots are run by crass people who can take the same kind of equipment and create hellholes. They make little bitty cubicles and stuff people in them. Barren, rat-hole places

* By then the damage was done, and we had two decades of working like this.

> What changed was technology

## Modernity - wifi - laptops

* With wifi and laptops, people aren't as tied to their desks as they had been before.
* People can work from cafes, hotels and from home.
* Hot desking was taken from the navy. Where it reepesents the idea of only having enough beds for half your crew. The 'hot' part is there because when you got into it it was already warm.

## Modernity - living room

* With less people always in the office there has been a desire to make it more like a house. With kitchens, libraries and break out areas.
* TV screens are now expected to work with devices. An element of fun was added with foosball tables and ping pong tables and beanbags.

"lot of chances to play wonderwall in this room"

## Biophilic

* Trends have come and gone but there has also been an increase in biophilic offices
* These introduce plants and living walls into office spaces
* Another aspect is providing background noise of water falling. Being near nature appears to make us calmer.

## Mini-Conclusion

* Trends keep coming in. It starts with anthrpologists creating something great, then people copying their designs but making them more regimented. We keep removing the human centered part of our designs.
* Modern offices will have parts for alone work and the house parts to make it look funky but I feel we are still optimising for one type of work. All together or all alone.
* It's open plan with a house attached to it.
