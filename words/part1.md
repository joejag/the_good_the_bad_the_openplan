# A Quick history of the office

## 1726: The Old Admiralty Office

* Some evidence of Romans having offices, but first dedicated office was in the 18th century
* Empire booming. Built in 1726 in London. The Old Admiralty Office. 
* Made to handle navy paperwork, meeting rooms and a boardroom (still used today)
* Three years later loads more dedicated offices appeared.

## Gov quote: thinking person

* 100 years later the government published a report saying:

```
 “for the intellectual work, separate rooms are necessary so that a person who works with his head may not be interrupted 
```

## Gov quote: mechanical work

```
but for the more mechanical work, the working in concert of a number of clerks in the same room under proper superintendence, is the proper mode of meeting it”
```

## Taylor image

* This idea was captured and perfected by Frederick Winslow Taylor. Agiles fav bad guy.
* Called this the scietific approach. For great efficiency.
* Failed to consider human and social elements. Maximum productivity

## Technology improved

* Electric lighting, aircon, and the telegraph system allowed offices to not be situated next to factories for the first time.
* The big changes were lifts and birth of steel frames. Which allowed sky scrapers to be created
* These changes made office design into a discipline and office design entered a new period. This new period was defined by having large rooms, with small ones off it. But mainly by having space.

## Frank Video

* Here is a video of Frank, on the first ever promotion for open plan, saying why he thinks open plan is great
* Yup, boxes are facist. I suppose in the early 20th century no one got to go around citing Godwin's law.
* Wright didn’t trust anyone’s taste over his own, so refused any furniture changes or wallpaper changes. "You'll get used to it".
* during my research I heard Open plan promoted as for comms/collab/inno but it's also anitfa

## The Johnson Wax company by Frank Lloyd Wright

* Frank Llyod Wright started experimenting with open plan offices in 1909.
* Wisconsin, 1939 he created his masterpiece. Designed a space for 200 sales workers to work together
* Notice the bright light, cork celing to trap noise and Dentriform columns (tree like)

## The Apartment Office Scene

* But most other did not take this much care with design work
* The desire to keep things with Taylor's scientific management style meant creamming folk in again
* Rather than working in the FLW building, we worked in a shitty copy
