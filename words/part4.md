* Open plan can be saved
  * "It's matters too much to not fix it": You spend your life there in stats
  * Noise reduction
  * Allow it to be redesigned: adapatable
  * Third way space: not quiet, but a noisy team area
  * Have private spaces for calls
* What you can influence
 * Org Leaders: Get cultural anthropologists in (you use UX for customers already)
 * Team leader: Ask to redesign the office space
 * Individual: Ask to put up barriers to sound, get a pot plant, leave (https://external-preview.redd.it/U-8gJ92KPtuoXweKFs8kvZ02pWLtD8RL035sBAlbja8.jpg?auto=webp&s=895f4f33ba0269abb199064dbf63985cc647f285)
