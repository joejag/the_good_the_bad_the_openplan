# Quotes

Amanda Stanaway (architecture firm Woods Bagot): "We must accept that organizational structures, technology, people and teams constantly change. The old paradigm of an office that is designed and remains fixed has become outdated as the dynamics of modern business and the way we interact and exchange information and ‘change’ become part of day to day working life.  A dynamic business requires a dynamic work workplace".

Frank Lloyd Wright: "The box was a facist symbol, and the architects of freedom need something different"

Professor Michelle Murphy:
Sick Building Syndrome and the Problem of Uncertainty: Environmental: "progressive companies let their employees pick the colour of their cubicle under a philospophy called 'participatory design'". "Uninspiring work can be tolerated if employees have the right to exercise influence over other areas of their work lives"

Rich: "I think you’re wrong about this...I think the physical space is critical..." 
Me: "Seriously? You think space comes before culture? " 
Rich: "Yeah. I think the space enables the cultural change."
