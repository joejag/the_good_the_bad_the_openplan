# The Good, the Bad, the Open plan: Creating environments for creative teams

[Slides for the talk](./slides.pdf)

*"creative types are the toughest"* - Grimaldi Design (1979) - on introducing open plan offices

The way we work has evolved at the same breakneck pace as where we work. We've torn down the cubicle farms and replaced them with seas of open plan offices. But, was that a good idea? How can we tell?

In this talk, we'll hear from scientific studies which measured the real impact of moving to open plan, scrutinising their acclaimed benefits and notorious drawbacks. We'll cover the alternatives that are on offer and what we can do to create an excellent space for our creative teams. 

Most of us can't directly change our office environment, but you'll hear how to influence it and learn the difference between your BÃ¼rolandschaft and your Biophilic offices along the way.

Headphones are not required.

## Notes

This talk is for anyone interested in how office environments impact our work and collaboration. Most people will not be able to change their office layout directly, so it caters for folk looking to influence things in their workplace.

This talk covers:

* A brief history of office designs
* Where Open Plan works well
* Why the standard form of Open Plan loses its benefits and keeps its drawbacks
* Highlights from scientific papers that prove the standard form of Open Plan doesn't work (they used wearables to measure conversations)
* What creative people need from an office to be effective
* What you can do to improve your office environment
